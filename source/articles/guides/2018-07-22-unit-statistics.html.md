There are a number of different statistics available within the Doubtfire LMS, which can be viewed at any time during a unit by the teaching staff. In this article, we will explore how to view and interpret the different types of statistics.

To view all unit statistics, from the *Administration* menu, select *manage units* and select the appropriate unit.

From the top-left menu, select *Unit Analytics:

<img alt="Unit Analytics" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/unit-analytics.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

You will now be presented with the unit analytics page.

## Unit Statistics

The first tab provides two CSV download options:

* Task Completion Statistics - A breakdown of each student's progress through the unit tasks.
* Tutor Assessment Statistics - A breakdown of the number of tasks assessed by each tutor in the unit *(useful for calculating marking pay)*

## Task Status Statistics

Task Status Statistics provides a breakdown of each task's status. For example in the image below, ~28% of the unit's tasks are complete.

<img alt="Task Status" src="/images/articles/staff/assign-staff-to-tutorial/task-status.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

Most of the statistics can be broken down into 3 categories noted by the three-switch at the top-right.

  1. Building Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout the whole unit.

  2. Pencil Icon - indicates the shown statistics are throughout an individual tutorial.

  3. Chart Icon - indicates the shown statistics are broken down by task.

  *Note:* These categories apply to multiple statistics views.

## Task Completion Statistics.

Shows the distribution of tasks completed in a unit. In the below example, this can be interpreted as out of the 10 tasks in the unit (Y axis), students have completed 3.5 on average.

## Target Grade Statistics.

Shows a breakdown of target grades chosen by students:

## Task Statistics

The task statistics page simply shows every student's progress in each of the tasks. Each bubble represents a tutorial, and the size of the bubble represents the amount of students in the tutorial. The placement of the tutorial across the X axis shows which state the task is in. In the example below, most of the tasks are in the "not started" state:
