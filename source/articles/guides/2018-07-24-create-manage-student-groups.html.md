To manage students in a group, first you need to ensure your unit has group sets setup. A group set is a definition of the types of groups you can have in a unit. To setup a group set:

1. Log in to Doubtfire
1. Select Manage Units from the Administration dropdown:

    <img alt="Manage Units" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/manage-units.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

1. Select the unit you wish to adminster
1. Select the *group* tab:
    <img alt="Manage Groups" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/group-set.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

1. Select *New Group Set*

    You will now see a new group created in the Group Set list, select the edit button to edit the following options:

    * Name - The name of the group set, by default this is "Group Work"
    * Create Groups - Who has permissions to create new groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
    * Manage Groups - Who has permissions to manage groups in the group set, staff, or staff and students.
    * Restrict to Tutorials - if true, only students from the same tutorial can be in a group.

1. Select *save* then select the group set in the group sets list to view more information:

    * Create a group of students in the group set, by typing a group name, and selecting *Create Group*:

    <img alt="Create Group" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/new-group.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

    * Add students to the group by typing the student name:

    <img alt="Adding Students to Group" src="/images/articles/staff/manage-students/adding-members.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

    You can also export and import CSV files for batch group allocation. To view the correct format of the CSV file for import, you can export the CSV by selecting *Download CSV*.
