summary: See how you can create and manage users in Doubtfire.

---

User accounts in Doubtfire include both students and staff accounts, and there are two ways to create user accounts -- manually and batch.

## Editing an Existing User:

Log in to Doubtfire and select *Manage Users* from the Administration dropdown in the top right menu:

<img alt="Manage Users" src="/images/articles/staff/create-manage-users/manage-users.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

To edit an existing user, select the user in the list, and this will open the *edit user* modal.

<img alt="Edit User" src="/images/articles/staff/create-manage-users/edit-users.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

From this menu, you can edit the following fields:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Avatar
* System Role - Student | Tutor | Convenor/Unit Chair | Administrator.

## Creating a New User:

From the Manage Users page, click the *Add New User* button on the bottom right to open the *Create User* modal. This is identical to the edit user modal previously discussed, however you can also set the username of the account:

<img alt="Create User" src="/images/articles/staff/create-manage-users/create-users.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

*Note:* Setting a username is permanent, and can not be changed.

## Batch Import/Export Users

Users can be batch imported and exported by using a CSV file. To find the format of the CSV to be uploaded, you can click the *download* button in the users export panel to view the format, even if there are no users enrolled.
