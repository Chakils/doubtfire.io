Marking student submissions in OnTrack is done throught the "Task Inbox" page. The Task Inbox is the default view after logging in to OnTrack, and selecting a unit.

1. Log in to OnTrack and select the unit from the "Units You Teach" list:

  <img alt="Select Unit" src="/images/articles/staff/mark-submissions/select-unit.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

2. The task inbox is divided into 3 panels: 

  1. Task List, the left panel
  2. The Submission, the center panel
  3. The Comments, the right panel.

3. To mark a submission, select the task from the task list, and view the submission in the center panel. There are a number of possible states you can place the task on, which are located on the bottom of the submission panel. In sequence of appearance these include:

  * Fail
  * Mark As Feedback Exceeded
  * Redo
  * Fix and Resubmit
  * Discuss
  * Demonstrate
  * Complete

  A description of each of these states can be read by hovering your mouse over the state:

  <img alt="View State Details" src="/images/articles/staff/mark-submissions/view-state-details.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

4. Select the desired state for the submission, and the state will instantly be updated:

  <img alt="State changed" src="/images/articles/students/change-target-grade/task-marked-updated.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

5. Leave a comment
  At any time during this process, you can leave a written, audio or image comment on the task. These comments are specific to each individual task between the teaching staff and the student. To leave an audio comment, simply click the *microphone* icon, and click "record". Ensure you are using a modern browser if audio comments are not working. Image comments can be uploaded by dragging the image into the comment field, and clicking send.
