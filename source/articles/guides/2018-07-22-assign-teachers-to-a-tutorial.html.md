Each tutorial in Doubtfire should have an assigned teaching staff member, to ensure that the submissions for the tutorial are directed to the correct teaching staff. To assign a tutor to a tutorial, simply log in to Doubtfire, and select manage units from the Administration dropdown:

Next, Select the appropriate unit to administer:

First, select the *staff* tab to ensure that the tutor you wish to assign is enrolled in the unit, and has the correct permission:

Once that is done, select the *tutorials* tab, and select the tutorial in the list you wish to assign a tutor to, then from the *Tutor* dropdown, select the appropriate tutor:
