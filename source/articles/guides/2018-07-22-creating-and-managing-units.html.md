Learning Outcomes can also be batch uploaded or downloaded, by using a CSV file in the right-hand-side upload/download panel.

## Staff
Select the third tab: *staff*

The staff for a unit include the unit chair, and tutors. These staff can easily be added to the unit by searching for the staff member's name, and then selecting the *Add Staff* button.

*Note:* The search field will autocompelte the staff members name, if the staff member you are trying to assign to a unit is not appearing, ensure the name is spelled correctly, and that the user has previously added to the Doubtfire system. See the enrolling users guide for more details.

## Tutorials
Select the fourth tab: *Tutorials*

Tutorials include the physical and cloud/online tutorials for a unit for which students will attend. Each tutorial will have a tutor from the teaching staff for the unit assigned.

<img alt="Tutorials" src="/images/articles/staff/create-manage-units/tutorials.png" style="width: 700px; display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

To create a new tutorial, simply select the *Add Tutorial* button, and fill in the fields in the modal. This includes:

* Abbreviation - A short abbreviation for the unit, example: LA1.
* Location - The room code for the tutorial. If the tutorial does not have a room, you can chose the text, for example "cloud1"
* Day - The day of the tutorial.
* Time - The time of the tutorial.
* Tutor - The staff member who will be taking the tutorial. This is the tutor who will receive the student submissions for the unit.

After completing the modal, simply select *Create Unit* to create the unit.

## Students
"Students" is the list of students who are enrolled into the unit. You can enroll students by batch, or manually. See the "Enroll and Manage Units" guide for more information on how to enroll and manage students.

## Tasks
The tasks are the individual learning tasks which your students will complete in a unit. See the "Creating and Managing Tasks" guide for more information.

## Task Alignment
Task Alignment is the relationship between a task, and each of the learning outcomes which were entered in a previous step. You should align each task to demonstrate how strongly it relates to a learning outcome.

For example, in this screenshot, task 1.1P Strongly aligns with the *CT* learning outcome (Critical Thinking), but only weakly (2/5) aligns with the *W* (Writing) learning outcome. You can present a rationale for each alignment.

## Groups
