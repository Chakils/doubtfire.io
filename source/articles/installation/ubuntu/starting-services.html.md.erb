Now that Ubuntu is running, we need to start Doubtfire.
First we'll initialise the API.
Open a terminal window, and navigate to ***~/Doubtfire/doubtfire-api/***.
Initialise the API by executing ***bundle exec rails s***.
This will spawn a rails process listening on ***localhost:3000***.

You can verify that the API is functional, and also interact with the API through the Swagger utility.
Access this utility by opening Firefox, and navigating to ***http://localhost:3000/api/docs/***.

We will now start the NodeJS environment to host the Doubtfire web interface.
To do so, open a new tab within your terminal window, and navigate to ***~/Doubtfire/doubtfire-web/***.
Then execute ***npm start***.

This will spawn a web server hosting the Doubtfire web interface, accessible at ***http://localhost:4200/***.
From here, you should experiment with both the API and the web interface.
It has been populated with dummy data, allowing you interact with the system to understand its functionality.
The default password is ***password***, and one user account on the system is ***aadmin***.
