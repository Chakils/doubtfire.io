There are multiple ways to deploy Doubtfire to an Ubuntu development environment: using a pre-packaged Doubtfire Virtual machine, automating the process using the installation scripts, or through a process of manually installing individual Doubtfire components and dependencies.

## Pre-packaged Virtual Machine

If you are new to the Doubtfire project, there is a pre-packaged virual machine that contains a fully-functional instance of Doubtfire.
This method of installation offers a quick, no fuss way to experiment with Doubtfire; to see what a functional installation should look like.
It allows you to interact with both the back-end API and the web interface, to test user functionality for the various user roles, and to familiarise yourself with the codebase.
However, installation through this method is limited:

- To minimise the size of the virtual machine itself, the virtualised instance of Doubtfire does not contain Latex, meaning that the platform's PDF functionality will not work.
- The virtual hard disk allocated to the machine has also been limited to the size required for a bare-bones Doubtfire installation.
- VirtualBox's overheads may impair the performance of Doubtfire software; it is recommended you run Doubtfire with an allocated hard drive of 20 GB or more, and with 4 GB or more of RAM.


This installation method requires you to install the VirtualBox software onto your host machine.
VirtualBox is an open-source hypervisor developed by Oracle.
It effectively emulates the hardware of a computer, within your existing computer and operating system--allowing you to run a computer within a computer.
Installation instructions are available through the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
Note: it may also be possible to install the packaged virtual machine using another hypervisor by exporting/importing the provided virtual machine.
This method has not been tested.

Once VirtualBox has been installed, download the [Doubtfire Virtual Machine](https://deakin365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jwtayl_deakin_edu_au/Ea5v4lk7mqZKi4bs9-sykoIBvtC9YY6JrYtneqIrp899fw?e=xJ0aH).

## Automated Installation Scripts

The automated installation scripts are the simplest way to install Doubtfire using Ubuntu as your fully-fledged development environment.

To begin, you will first need to clone the `doubtfire-web`, `doubtfire-api`, and `doubtfire.io` repositories.
Before doing so, you should fork each of these respositories to your own Github account, to allow your own development and enable the creation of pull requests at a later stage.
You should also consider 




<% current_page.children.sort_by(&:url).each_with_index do |step, i| %>
- **[Step <%= i+1 %>](<%= step.url %>)**: <%= step.data.title %>
<% end %>

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to begin
using Doubtfire.
