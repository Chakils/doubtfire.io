There are multiple ways to deploy Doubtfire to an Ubuntu development environment: using a pre-packaged Doubtfire Virtual machine, automating the process using the installation scripts, or through a process of manually installing individual Doubtfire components and dependencies. Visit one of the below links to explore your preferred method of installation:

- [Pre-packaged Virtual Machine](./virtual-machine/)
- [Automated Installation Scripts](./installation-scripts/)
- [Manual Installation](./manual-installation-guides-for-doubtfire-for-ubuntu/)

Once you have completed the installation process using your selected method, you will then need to start Doubtfire's respective services.
This process is described in the following link:

- [Starting Doubtfire's Services](./starting-services/)

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to begin using and contributing to Doubtfire!
