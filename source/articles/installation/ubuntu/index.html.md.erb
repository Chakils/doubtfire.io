There are multiple ways to deploy Doubtfire to an Ubuntu development environment: using a pre-packaged Doubtfire Virtual machine, automating the process using the installation scripts, or through a process of manually installing individual Doubtfire components and dependencies.

## Pre-packaged Virtual Machine

If you are new to the Doubtfire project, there is a pre-packaged virtual machine that contains a fully-functional instance of Doubtfire.
This method of installation offers a quick, no fuss way to experiment with Doubtfire; to see what a functional installation should look like.
It allows you to interact with both the back-end API and the web interface, to test user functionality for the various user roles, and to familiarise yourself with the codebase.
However, installation through this method is limited:

- To minimise the size of the virtual machine itself, the virtualised instance of Doubtfire does not contain Latex, meaning that the platform's PDF functionality will not work.
- The virtual hard disk allocated to the machine has also been limited to the size required for a bare-bones Doubtfire installation.
- VirtualBox's overheads may impair the performance of Doubtfire software; it is recommended you run Doubtfire with an allocated hard drive of 20 GB or more, and with 4 GB or more of RAM.

This installation method requires you to install the VirtualBox software onto your host machine.
VirtualBox is an open-source hypervisor developed by Oracle.
It effectively emulates the hardware of a computer, within your existing computer and operating system--allowing you to run a computer within a computer.
Installation instructions are available through the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
Note: it may also be possible to install the packaged virtual machine using another hypervisor by exporting/importing the provided virtual machine.
This method has not been tested.

Once VirtualBox has been installed, download the [Doubtfire Virtual Machine](https://deakin365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jwtayl_deakin_edu_au/Ea5v4lk7mqZKi4bs9-sykoIBvtC9YY6JrYtneqIrp899fw?e=xJ0aH).
Import the Virtual Machine into VirtualBox using the import utility, as depicted below.

Once the Virtual Machine has been imported, starting the machine should load Ubuntu desktop.
Note that ***doubtfire*** is both the username *and* password for this Ubuntu machine.

## Automated Installation Scripts

The automated installation scripts are the simplest way to install Doubtfire using Ubuntu as your fully-fledged development environment.

To begin, you will first need to clone the `doubtfire-web`, `doubtfire-api`, and `doubtfire.io` repositories.
Before doing so, you should fork each of these respositories to your own Github account, to allow your own development and enable the creation of pull requests at a later stage.
You should also consider 

## Manual Installation

Please refer to respective Wiki and Readme.md pages in [Doubtfire's Github](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/) `doubtfire-web`, `doubtfire-api`, and `doubtfire.io` repositories.
These details will be included in this guide in future updates.

## Starting the services

Now that Ubuntu is running, we need to start Doubtfire.
First we'll initialise the API.
Open a terminal window, and navigate to ***~/Doubtfire/doubtfire-api/***.
Initialise the API by executing ***bundle exec rails s***.
This will spawn a rails process listening on ***localhost:3000***.

You can verify that the API is functional, and also interact with the API through the Swagger utility.
Access this utility by opening Firefox, and navigating to ***http://localhost:3000/api/docs/***.

We will now start the NodeJS environment to host the Doubtfire web interface.
To do so, open a new tab within your terminal window, and navigate to ***~/Doubtfire/doubtfire-web/***.
Then execute ***npm start***.

This will spawn a web server hosting the Doubtfire web interface, accessible at ***http://localhost:4200/***.
From here, you should experiment with both the API and the web interface.
It has been populated with dummy data, allowing you interact with the system to understand its functionality.
The default password is ***password***, and one user account on the system is ***aadmin***.

## Conclusion

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to begin using and contributing to Doubtfire!
