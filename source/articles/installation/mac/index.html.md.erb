For installing Doubtfire applications on Mac OS, we can only do it by Manual process

To get Doubtfire installed on macOS, follow the steps below:

<% current_page.children.sort_by(&:url).each_with_index do |step, i| %>
- **[Step <%= i+1 %>](<%= step.url %>)**: <%= step.data.title %>
<% end %>

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to
using Doubtfire.
